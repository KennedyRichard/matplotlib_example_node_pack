# matplotlib_example_node_pack
Example node pack with nodes using matplotlib

This node pack is meant to be used with the [Nodezator][] app. It is just a small node pack with some example nodes using the [matplotlib][] library. These are the same nodes used in the [video][] presenting the Nodezator app.

Don't forget to install matplotlib in the Python implementation you use to run nodezator, so that the nodes can be loaded without a problem.
