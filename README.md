# matplotlib_example_node_pack

Example node pack with nodes using matplotlib

This node pack is meant to be used within the [Nodezator](https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator) app. It is just a small node pack with some example nodes using the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library. These are the same nodes used in the [video](https://youtu.be/GlQJvuU7Z_8?t=1065) presenting the Nodezator app.

Don't forget to install matplotlib in the Python implementation you use to run nodezator, so that the nodes can be loaded without a problem.

A sample .ndz file can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/187P_dOvtfu4hwnV2fSvOWWK9AXpcZv1B/view?usp=share_link). When opening the file for the first time the app will ask for the location of the node pack in your system in order to load the nodes.
